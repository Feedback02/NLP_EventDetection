<h1>NLP Event Detection Repository</h1>

<p>This repository contains an NLP project focused on solving the Event Detection Problem. The project involves implementing two approaches to address the problem: one based on a common baseline approach (<code>common-baseline.ipynb</code>) and the other utilizing a model-based solution (<code>ModelTraining.ipynb</code>).</p>

<h2>Project Files</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>common-baseline.ipynb</strong>: This Jupyter notebook presents an approach to solving the problem without utilizing neural networks. It demonstrates a common baseline method for addressing the Event Detection NLP problem.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>ModelTraining.ipynb</strong>: This Jupyter notebook provides the model-based approach to solve the problem. It showcases the process of training a model, leveraging neural networks or similar techniques.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Usage</h2>
